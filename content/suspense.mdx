When a user loads your app, you want to show a fully interactive page as soon as possible. However, the page **cannot be interactive before the JavaScript code fully loads**. This includes both React itself and your application code.

Server-side rendering lets you render React components on the server into HTML and send them as soon as possible. Once both React and your application code loads, React will hydrate it and make it interactive for the user.

So on paper, here's how both rendering methods stack against each other:

## What are the problems with SSR today?

> SSR forces you between doing something early, or doing something late. Why? Cause neither of the stages can start until the previous stage has finished for the app

> Dealing with lots of things at once is not the same as doing lots of things at once

The most important addition in React 18 is **concurrency**. React solves the problems with SSR using concurrency as a mechanism that enables our applications to have multiple versions of its UI at any time without blocking the _main thread_.

## Where does Suspense fit in all this?

_Suspense_ lets you declaratively specify the loading state for a part of the component tree if it's not yet ready to be displayed.

> Concurrency in React 18 is unlocked by Suspense, making "UI Loading state" a first class declarative concept in the React programming model.

**Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component**, such as:

-   Lazy-loading component code using `lazy()` (_pre-React 18_)
-   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay, Next.js, Remix

```jsx showLineNumbers
<div>
    <Card />
    <Suspense fallback={<PhotoSkeleton />}>
        <Photo />
    </Suspense>
</div>
<div>
    <Suspense fallback={<ContentSkeleton />}>
        <Content />
    </Suspense>
</div>
```

Conceptually, you can think of Suspense as being similar to a `catch` block. However, instead of catching errors, it catches components "suspending". Any component in the tree can "suspend", which means that it's not ready to render.

## What are the biggest perks of using Suspense with React 18?

-   **Streaming HTML** lets you start emitting HTML as early as youâ€™d like, streaming HTML for additional content together with the `<script>` tags that put them in the right places.
-   **Selective Hydration** lets you start hydrating your app as early as possible, before the rest of the HTML and the JavaScript code are fully downloaded. It also prioritizes hydrating the parts the user is interacting with, creating an illusion of instant hydration.

These features solve three long-standing problems with SSR in React:

-   You no longer have to wait for all the data to load on the server before sending HTML.
-   You no longer have to wait for all JavaScript to load to start hydrating.
-   You no longer have to wait for all components to hydrate to start interacting with the page.

> Suspense serves as an opt-in for all of these features. This demonstrates the power of expressing loading states declaratively.
