Streaming allows you to incrementally send UI from the server to client, progressively rendering components and pages. This allows part of the content to be displayed faster without waiting for all data fetching and rendering to complete before the UI is rendered.

Streaming is particularly beneficial when there's a slow network request for retrieving data. Rather than the entire page being blocked from rendering due to a slow API or database lookup, UI can be incrementally sent to the client so Users don't have to wait for the entire page to load before they can start interacting with it.

```jsx showLineNumbers
<section>
    <Card />
    <Suspense fallback={<PhotoSkeleton />}>
        {/* @ts-expect-error Async Server Component */}
        <Photo />
    </Suspense>
</section>
<section>
    <Suspense fallback={<ContentSkeleton />}>
        {/* @ts-expect-error Async Server Component */}
        <Content />
    </Suspense>
</section>
```
