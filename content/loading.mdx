Next.js 13 introduced a new file convention, `loading.js`, to help you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

```jsx showLineNumbers
export default function Loading() {
    // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
    return <LoadingSkeleton />;
}
```

In the same folder, `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`. It'll wrap the page.js file and any children below in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

```jsx showLineNumbers
<Layout>
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <Page />
    </Suspense>
</Layout>
```
