TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that's able to craft any design, directly in your markup. It supports OOTB a set of utilities for animation elements with composable CSS animations such as:

-   `animate-spin`
-   `animate-ping`
-   `animate-pulse`
-   `animate-bounce`

> Can you guess which of these animations was done without using TailwindCSS?
