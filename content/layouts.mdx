The hierarchy of the `app` folder maps directly to URL paths (as long as each of those directories contain a `page.tsx` file). However, it's possible to break out of this pattern by creating a **route group**. These are good for:

-   Organizing routes without affecting the URL structure.
-   Opting-in specific route segments into different layouts, suspense/error boundaries and meta tags.
-   Creating multiple root layouts by splitting your application.

Good things to know:

-   The naming of route groups has no special meaning other than for organizing. They do not affect the URL path.
-   Routes inside route groups **should not** resolve to the same URL path. e.g., `(marketing)/about/page.tsx` and `(shop)/about/page.tsx` would both resolve to `/about` and cause an error.
